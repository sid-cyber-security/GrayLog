Hello, my friend!

In order to work out the rules in GrayLog as described here, you need to do everything step by step:
1. Set up audit.d
2. Set up pam.d
3. Add Grok Patterns to the system
4. Wait and check if all the required fields have appeared in the GrayLog logs.
5. Add alerts-events rules
6. Check result
