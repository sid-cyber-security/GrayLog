Hello my friend!

Some patterns have "key" fields added. 
This is because I add a label to specific events using auditd rules. 
So don't forget to add the rules to /etc/audit/rules.d first.
Restart the auditd daemon and check if the rules have been applied with the command "auditctl -l".
You can go back to the auditd.rules folder and see them in my github)
